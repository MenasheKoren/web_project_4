Project 4
This is a demonstrative project, in coordination with Practicum100 about pictures that people take accross the U.S., in which a user is able to change the name and/or the profession in the profile via a pop-up form.

The site is now partially interactive. The user is now able to add, remove and like pictures, and the popups are opened and closed with a smooth transition.

In the future we plan on making the site fully interactive, with the ability to change the profile picture and add vaildations.
