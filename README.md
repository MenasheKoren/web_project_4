**Intro**

This is a demonstrative project, in coordination with Practicum100 about pictures that people take accross the U.S., in which a user is able to change the name and/or the profession in the profile via a pop-up form.

**Upcoming**

In the future we plan on making the site fully interactive, with the ability to change the profile picture as well as add/remove their own photos. In addition, the user should be able to like pictures they enjoy.

**Technologies**

This project was done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript via Vim as the text editor.
